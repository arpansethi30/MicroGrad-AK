# Micrograd Learning Project

This repository contains my implementation and learning journey of the [Micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) project, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0).

## Overview

Micrograd is a tiny autograd engine and a neural network library, implemented from scratch in Python. This project serves as an educational tool to understand the fundamentals of backpropagation and neural network training.

## Contents

- `micrograd/`: Contains the core implementation of the autograd engine and neural network components.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of micrograd for various learning tasks.
- `examples/`: Example scripts showcasing different neural network architectures and their training processes.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for ensuring the correctness of the implementation.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

### Running Examples

You can run the example scripts to see micrograd in action. For instance:

```bash
python examples/train_mnist.py
```

### Using Jupyter Notebooks

Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open and run the notebooks to see step-by-step explanations and visualizations of the training processes.
